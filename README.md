# Caesar Cipher

This [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) program implements a Caesar cipher for encryption and decryption of text.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. A Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, "hello" becomes "khoor." This type of cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who is believed to have used it for secure communication.

## Additional Notes

While it's suitable for educational purposes, it's not cryptographically secure due to its simplicity. Modern encryption methods use more complex algorithms and larger key sizes for stronger security.
